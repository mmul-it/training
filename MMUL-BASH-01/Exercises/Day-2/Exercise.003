# Exercise 003 - Mounting a filesystem

1) View active mounts

2) Create a mountpoint called "ram_disk", and mount (as root) a new filesystem:
  - type tmpfs
  - options size=512k
  - device tmpfs

3) Verify mount of ram_disk

4) Create a file into the new filesystem, and list it

5) Umount (as root) ram_disk

6) Verify ram_disk is now empty and remove mountpoint
