# Exercise 006 - Create a systemd custom service

1) Log into the machine with the credentials you own;

2) Create a file in your homedir called service_action;

3) Edit the file as follow:
   ```
   AUTHOR="**INSERT YOUR USERNAME HERE**"
   
   while true
   do
   echo "Example service from author: ${AUTHOR}"
   sleep 5;
   done
   ```

4) Create a service unit named $USER_exercise.service with this content:
   ```
   [Unit]
   Description=*INSERT YOUR USERNAME HERE*

   [Service]
   Type=simple
   ExecStart=/bin/bash /home/*INSERT YOUR USERNAME HERE*/service_action

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

5) Change the mode of the newly created service so that the file can be
   written and read by owner, read by group, read by other;

6) Copy the newly created service in /etc/systemd/system/

7) With your user, start the newly created service and query its status;

8) Notice service status and the log in the "output";
