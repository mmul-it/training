# Lab | Exposing your application

In this lab you will:

1. As developer, deploy mariadb and tomcat applications into the project
   `expose-test`.
2. Verify if Deployments, Pods and Services are up and running.
3. Expose both applications.
4. Verify that both applications are reachable. Is it true? Understand why just
   'tomcat' can be reached and find out a way to expose mariadb.
5. Cleanup everything.

## Solution

1. Login as `developer` and create the new `expose-test` project:

   ```console
   $ oc login -u developer
   Logged into "https://api.crc.testing:6443" as "developer" using existing credentials.
   ...

   $ oc new-project expose-test
   Now using project "expose-test" on server "https://api.crc.testing:6443".
   ...
   ```

   Create the two applications:

   ```console
   $ oc new-app mariadb MYSQL_USER=user MYSQL_PASSWORD=pass MYSQL_DATABASE=testdb -l db=mariadb
   --> Found image bde1f31 (3 weeks old) in image stream "openshift/mariadb" under tag "10.3-el8" for "mariadb"
   ...

   $ oc new-app tomcat
   --> Found container image 36ef696 (12 days old) from Docker Hub for "tomcat"
   ...
   ```

2. Check the status of the various components:

   ```console
   $ oc status
   In project expose-test on server https://api.crc.testing:6443

   svc/mariadb - 10.217.5.78:3306
     deployment/mariadb deploys openshift/mariadb:10.3-el8
       deployment #2 running for 4 minutes - 1 pod
       deployment #1 deployed 4 minutes ago

   svc/tomcat - 10.217.5.122:8080
     deployment/tomcat deploys istag/tomcat:latest
       deployment #2 running for 3 minutes - 1 pod
       deployment #1 deployed 3 minutes ago
   2 infos identified, use `oc status --suggest` to see details.

   $ oc get deployment
   NAME      READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
   mariadb   1/1     1            1           4m24s
   tomcat    1/1     1            1           3m39s

   $ oc get pods
   NAME                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   mariadb-6844d48bf6-wc66z   1/1     Running   0          4m35s
   tomcat-d7cdc4676-59f6h     1/1     Running   0          3m48s

   $ oc get svc
   NAME      TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
   mariadb   ClusterIP   10.217.5.78    <none>        3306/TCP   4m42s
   tomcat    ClusterIP   10.217.5.122   <none>        8080/TCP   3m57s
   ```

3. Use `oc expose` to expose the services:

   ```console
   $ oc expose svc/tomcat
   route.route.openshift.io/tomcat exposed

   $ oc expose svc/mariadb
   route.route.openshift.io/mariadb exposed

   $ oc status
   ...
   http://mariadb-expose-test.apps-crc.testing to pod port 3306-tcp (svc/mariadb)
     deployment/mariadb deploys openshift/mariadb:10.3-el8
       deployment #2 running for 5 minutes - 1 pod
       deployment #1 deployed 5 minutes ago

   http://tomcat-expose-test.apps-crc.testing to pod port 8080-tcp (svc/tomcat)
     deployment/tomcat deploys istag/tomcat:latest
       deployment #2 running for 4 minutes - 1 pod
       deployment #1 deployed 4 minutes ago
   ...
   ```

4. Using `curl`, let's check how the services answer:

   ```console
   $ curl http://tomcat-expose-test.apps-crc.testing
   <!doctype html><html lang="en"><head><title>...<h3>Apache Tomcat/9.0.50</h3></body></html>

   $ curl http://mariadb-expose-test.apps-crc.testing
   <html><body><h1>502 Bad Gateway</h1>
   The server returned an invalid or incomplete response.
   </body></html>
   ```

   The mariadb can't be reached by http, that is why we get '502 Bad Gateway',
   so it is possible to remove it:

   ```console
   $ oc get route
   NAME      HOST/PORT                              PATH   SERVICES   PORT       TERMINATION   WILDCARD
   mariadb   mariadb-expose-test.apps-crc.testing          mariadb    3306-tcp                 None
   tomcat    tomcat-expose-test.apps-crc.testing           tomcat     8080-tcp                 None

   $ oc delete route mariadb
   route.route.openshift.io "mariadb" deleted

   $ oc get route
   NAME     HOST/PORT                             PATH   SERVICES   PORT       TERMINATION   WILDCARD
   tomcat   tomcat-expose-test.apps-crc.testing          tomcat     8080-tcp                 None
   ```

   It is possible to define a Nodeport to expose the 3306 port, this can be
   done via oc expose:

   ```console
   $ oc expose deployment mariadb --type=NodePort --target-port=3306 --name=mariadbnp
   service/mariadbnodeport exposed

   $ oc get svc
   NAME        TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
   mariadb     ClusterIP   10.217.5.79    <none>        3306/TCP         8m5s
   mariadbnp   NodePort    10.217.4.190   <none>        3306:31384/TCP   3s
   tomcat      ClusterIP   10.217.5.9     <none>        8080/TCP         7m57s
   ```

   This will expose the upper port 31384 on all the OpenShift nodes, in this
   case only one, the crc host.

   The crc ip can be obtained by using the `crc ip` command, and the `mysql`
   client is part of the `mariab` package (`sudo yum -y install mariadb` on RHEL
   based systems or `sudo apt install -y mariadb-client-core`):

   ```console
   $ mysql --host=$(crc ip) --port=31384 --user=user --password=pass --database=testdb
