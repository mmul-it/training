# Lab | Customize a Deployment on OpenShift

In this lab you will:

1. Create a yaml or json file containing Deployment specifications. You can
   obtain a prepared yaml to explore use oc-new app with yaml output:

   ``` console
   $ oc new-app mariadb MYSQL_USER=user MYSQL_PASSWORD=pass MYSQL_DATABASE=testdb -l db=mariadb -o yaml > mariadb-deployment.yaml
   ...
   ```

2. Explore the yaml: you can customize it before creating the resources on
   OpenShift.
   There are 3 different resources defined in this yaml:

   - ImageStreamTag: provides a metod to keep an image in the OpenShift
     internal registry synced with an external registry;
   - Deployment: which keep informations about how Pods are composed, how many
     replicas, and when to react to changes;
   - Service: a method to expose applications outside the OpenShift cluster.
     We will explore Services in further chapters;

3. Customize the Deployment resource to add a label "zone: dmz" and ensure
   at least 2 replicas of the Pods. Also remove the Service part;

4. Create the resources on your OpenShift cluster with ```oc create```;

5. Observe the results;

6. Delete all the resources using the specific tag "zone: dmz" created above;

## Solution

1. Login as developer and create the 'my-first-project':

   ```console
   $ oc login -u developer
   Logged into "https://api.crc.testing:6443" as "developer" using existing credentials.

   You don't have any projects. You can try to create a new project, by running

       oc new-project <projectname>

   $ oc new-project my-first-project
   Now using project "my-first-project" on server "https://api.crc.testing:6443".

   You can add applications to this project with the 'new-app' command. For example, try:

       oc new-app rails-postgresql-example

   to build a new example application in Ruby. Or use kubectl to deploy a simple Kubernetes application:

       kubectl create deployment hello-node --image=k8s.gcr.io/serve_hostname
   ```

   Use the command `oc new-app` to create the yaml file:

   ```console
   $ oc new-app mariadb MYSQL_USER=user MYSQL_PASSWORD=pass MYSQL_DATABASE=testdb -l db=mariadb -o yaml > mariadb-deployment.yaml
   ...
   ```

2. Check the content of *mariadb-deployment.yaml*:

   ```console
   $ cat mariadb-deployment.yaml
   ...
   ```

   Or if you want to extract just the main resources defined:

   ```console
   $ grep "  kind:" mariadb-deployment.yaml
     kind: Deployment
     kind: Service
   ```

3. While editing the file:

   - In the Deployment section, look for `spec:` and its `replicas:` definition.
     Change the value from 1 to 2.
   - In the Deployment section, add `zone: dmz` in `metadata:labels:` and
     `spec:template:metadata:labels:`.
   - Remove entirely the Service resource (with kind: Service).

4. Create the deployment with `oc create -f`:

   ```console
   $ oc create -f mariadb-deployment.yaml
   imagestreamtag.image.openshift.io/mariadb:10.3-el8 created
   deployment.apps/mariadb created
   ```

5. Use `oc describe deployment` to get details of the deployment:

   ```console
   $ oc describe deployment mariadb
   Name:                   mariadb
   Namespace:              my-first-project
   CreationTimestamp:      Wed, 14 Jul 2021 17:10:00 +0200
   Labels:                 app=mariadb
                           app.kubernetes.io/component=mariadb
                           app.kubernetes.io/instance=mariadb
                           db=mariadb
                           zone=dmz
   ...
   ...

   $ oc get deployment -l zone=dmz
   NAME      READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
   mariadb   2/2     2            2           66s

   $ oc get pods
   NAME                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   mariadb-64bcf6dd4c-4vqzs   1/1     Running   0          76s
   mariadb-64bcf6dd4c-l4rdh   1/1     Running   0          80s

   $ oc logs mariadb-64bcf6dd4c-4vqzs
   => sourcing 20-validate-variables.sh ...
   => sourcing 25-validate-replication-variables.sh ...
   => sourcing 30-base-config.sh ...
   ---> 15:10:09     Processing basic MySQL configuration files ...
   => sourcing 60-replication-config.sh ...
   => sourcing 70-s2i-config.sh ...

   => sourcing 50-my-tuning.cnf ...
   ---> 15:10:09     Initializing database ...
   ...
   ...
   ```

6. Using `oc delete` with -l to select zone, delete all the elements:

   ```console
   $ oc delete all -l zone=dmz
   pod "mariadb-64bcf6dd4c-4vqzs" deleted
   pod "mariadb-64bcf6dd4c-l4rdh" deleted
   deployment.apps "mariadb" deleted
   replicaset.apps "mariadb-5db7475f4" deleted
   replicaset.apps "mariadb-64bcf6dd4c" deleted

   $ oc status
   In project my-first-project on server https://api.crc.testing:6443

   You have no services, deployment configs, or build configs.
   Run 'oc new-app' to create an application.

   $ oc delete project my-first-project
   project.project.openshift.io "my-first-project" deleted
   ```
