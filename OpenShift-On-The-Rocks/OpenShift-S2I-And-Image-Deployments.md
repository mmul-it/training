# Lab | Deploy some applications from git and from Docker images

In this lab you will:

1. As `developer` create a new `test-deployments` project.
2. Create a new app from the GitHub repository [https://github.com/mmul-it/docker/](https://github.com/mmul-it/docker/).
   You must specify the `s2i-php-helloworld` directory as the context dir.
3. Check the progress of the deployment.
4. Expose and test the deployed application.
5. Clean everything.
6. Create a new app from the nginx official Docker image.
7. Expose and test the deployed application.
8. Clean everything.

## Solution

1. Login as `developer` on the cluster:

   ```console
   $ oc login -u developer
   Logged into "https://api.crc.testing:6443" as "developer" using existing credentials.
   ```

   Then create the new project:

   ```console
   $ oc new-project test-deployments
   Now using project "test-deployments" on server "https://api.crc.testing:6443".
   ```

2. To start operating with Git repositories the `oc` command relies on the `git`
   command, which needs to be installed, depending on the used distribution (for
   Debian based systems `sudo apt -y install git`, for Red Hat based systems
   `yum -y install git`).

   When the `git` command is available, the `oc new-app` command can be
   launched. You must specify the name, the git repository and the `context-dir`
   where the application code is available:

   ```console
   $ oc new-app --name=myapp https://github.com/mmul-it/docker/ --context-dir=s2i-php-helloworld
   --> Found image b416a19 (3 weeks old) in image stream "openshift/php" under tag "7.4-ubi8" for "php"
   ...
   --> Success
       Build scheduled, use 'oc logs -f buildconfig/myapp' to track its progress.
       Application is not exposed. You can expose services to the outside world by executing one or more of the commands below:
        'oc expose service/myapp'
       Run 'oc status' to view your app.
   ```

   You can now see your app status:

   ```console
   $ oc status
   In project test-deployments on server https://api.crc.testing:6443

   svc/myapp - 10.217.4.73 ports 8080, 8443
     deployment/myapp deploys istag/myapp:latest <-
       bc/myapp source builds https://github.com/mmul-it/docker/ on openshift/php:7.4-ubi8
       deployment #2 running for 10 minutes - 1 pod
       deployment #1 deployed 12 minutes ago
   ```

   As you can see the new-app is composed by a Service, a Deployment, a
   BuildConfig and two pods.

   ```console
   $ oc get pods
   NAME                     READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
   myapp-1-build            0/1     Completed   0          14m
   myapp-7687d69fdf-9n9jt   1/1     Running     0          12m
   ```

   one pod is used for the build process, the other contains the resulting
   container.

3. You can check any time the progress of the building process by looking at the
   logs of the BuildConfig resource:

   ```console
   $ oc logs -f buildconfig/myapp
   ...
   Successfully pushed image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/test-deployments/myapp@sha256:00b94db50f561b92723a3635300a0f580762c159d665ca6262a3851539f77bf5
   Push successful
   ```

4. You can now use the ```oc expose``` command to make the application available
   outside the cluster:

   ```console
   $ oc expose svc/myapp
   route.route.openshift.io/myapp exposed

   $ oc get routes
   NAME    HOST/PORT                                 PATH   SERVICES   PORT       TERMINATION   WILDCARD
   myapp   myapp-test-deployments.apps-crc.testing          myapp      8080-tcp                 None
   ```

   And test the application:

   ```console
   $ curl http://myapp-test-deployments.apps-crc.testing ; echo
   Welcome in MMUL!
   ```

5. Application removal can be done in two steps. First of all remove the
   application service and route:

   ```console
   $ oc delete route/myapp service/myapp
   route.route.openshift.io "myapp" deleted
   service "myapp" deleted
   ```

   Then you can delete the Deployment and the BuildConfig resources. This will
   delete also the two pods.

   ```console
   $ oc delete deployment/myapp buildconfig/myapp
   deployment.apps "myapp" deleted
   buildconfig.build.openshift.io "myapp" deleted

   $ oc get pods
   NAME                     READY   STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE
   myapp-1-build            0/1     Completed     0          20m
   myapp-7687d69fdf-9n9jt   0/1     Terminating   0          18m

   $ oc get pods
   No resources found in test-deployments namespace.
   ```

6. Creating a new app from a Docker image it's easy as passing the image name
   to the ```oc new-app``` command:

   ```console
   $ oc new-app --image=nginxinc/nginx-unprivileged --name=nginx
   --> Found container image 9715b46 (2 weeks old) from Docker Hub for "nginxinc/nginx-unprivileged"
   ...
   --> Success
   ...
   ```

   Then you can check what is created:

   ```console
   In project test-deployments on server https://api.crc.testing:6443

   svc/nginx - 10.217.4.105:8080
     deployment/nginx deploys istag/nginx:latest
       deployment #2 running for 34 seconds - 1 pod
       deployment #1 deployed 36 seconds ago
   1 info identified, use 'oc status --suggest' to see details.
   ```

   As you can see, creating an app from a Docker image doesn't require to build
   anything, so the BuildConfig wasn't create.

7. As before, expose the application by using the Service name:

   ```console
   $ oc expose service nginx
   route.route.openshift.io/nginx exposed

   $ oc get routes
   NAME    HOST/PORT                                 PATH   SERVICES   PORT       TERMINATION   WILDCARD
   nginx   nginx-test-deployments.apps-crc.testing          nginx      8080-tcp                 None
   ```

   Then curl the provided host to check the app:

   ```console
   $ curl http://nginx-test-deployments.apps-crc.testing
   ...
   <h1>Welcome to nginx!</h1>
   ...
   ```

8. Clean the route and services:

   ```console
   $ oc delete route/nginx service/nginx
   route.route.openshift.io "nginx" deleted
   service "nginx" deleted
   ```

   This time you can just delete the Deployment, it will also delete the pod:

   ```console
   $ oc delete deployment nginx
   deployment.apps "nginx" deleted

   $ oc get pods
   NAME                   READY   STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE
   nginx-54bcd565-mx9zq   0/1     Terminating   0          4m39s

   $ oc get pods
   No resources found in test-deployments namespace.

   $ oc delete project test-deployments
   project.project.openshift.io "test-deployments" deleted
   ```
