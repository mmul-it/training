# Argo CD Workshop - Stage 1

The lab will be based on three Kubernetes clusters created using [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/)
and instructions on how to install `kind` and configure everything are available
in [Kubernetes-Install-3-Kind-Clusters.md](../../Common/Kubernetes-Install-3-Kind-Clusters.md).

Once everything is in place, it is possible to proceed with [Stage 2](Stage-2-MetalLB-Installation.md).
