# Lab | Play with default values and expansions

In this lab you will:

1. Create a file `default_answer.sh` Adding a variable in the script and named
   `ANSWER`. Give it the value of the first positional parameter `$1`.
2. Make the script print: `The answer to life, the universe and everything is
   42`. The value `42` must be written as a default value if no positional
   parameter is passed during script execution.
3. Using substring removal, print the name of the script you are running.
4. Execute the script and pass a parameter, check the output. Execute the script
   again without passing a parameter, check the difference in the output.

## Solution

1. ->
2. ->
3. Resulting file will have this look:

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash

   # 2) Variable declaration
   ANSWER=$1

   # 3) Print the variable with a default
   echo "The answer to life, the universe and everything is ${ANSWER:=42}"

   # 4) Name of the script without `.sh`
   echo "Name of the script is ${0%%.sh}"
   ```

4. Execute the script twice as requested. Provide a parameter in the first run,
   leave the default value for the second run:

   ```console
   $ ./default_answer pizza
   The answer to life, the universe and everything is pizza
   Name of the script is ./default_answer

   $ ./default_answer
   The answer to life, the universe and everything is 42
   Name of the script is ./default_answer
   ```
