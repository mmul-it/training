# Lab | IaC multiple choice quiz

In this lab you will be asked ten questions about IaC, only one answer is
correct for each question.

## Questions

1. **What does Infrastructure as Code (IaC) primarily aim to achieve?**
    1. Consistency and automation
    2. Manual configuration
    3. Physical infrastructure setup
    4. Unplanned changes
2. **Which of the following is an example of declarative IaC tool?**
    1. Bash scripts
    2. Puppet
    3. Python scripts
    4. Ansible
3. **What is idempotency in the context of IaC?**
    1. Applying the same configuration multiple times results in different
       states
    2. Applying the same configuration multiple times results in the same state
    3. Applying configuration manually
    4. Ensuring configurations are never applied more than once
4. **Which practice is essential for managing changes in IaC?**
    1. Manual updates
    2. Direct changes to live environments
    3. Version control
    4. Ignoring configuration history
5. **What is Continuous Integration (CI)?**
    1. A method to perform manual tests
    2. A practice of merging code changes frequently and automatically testing
       them
    3. A technique for configuring servers manually
    4. A way to deploy code directly to production without testing
6. **In a declarative approach, which aspect is emphasized?**
    1. Describing the desired state
    2. Defining the exact steps to achieve a state
    3. Automating configurations
    4. Writing detailed scripts
7. **In an imperative approach, which aspect is emphasized?**
    1. Describing the desired state
    2. Using declarative syntax
    3. Automating configurations
    4. Defining the exact steps to achieve a state
8. **Why is automated testing important in a CI pipeline for IaC?**
    1. To manually verify each change
    2. To slow down the deployment process
    3. To ensure changes do not introduce errors or inconsistencies
    4. To apply configurations directly to production
9. **What is the main advantage of using declarative configuration management**
   tools?
    1. They require more detailed scripting
    2. They ensure the system reaches and maintains a desired state with less
       manual intervention
    3. They are always faster than imperative tools
    4. They are harder to learn and implement
10. **Which of the following best describes version control?**
    1. Keeping track of changes by manually recording them
    2. Preventing changes to code once it is deployed
    3. Discarding old versions of code and configurations
    4. A system for managing changes to code and configurations with a history
       of changes

## Answers

1. **1**. Consistency and automation
2. **4**. Ansible (using playbooks)
3. **2**. Applying the same configuration multiple times results in the same
   state
4. **3**. Version control
5. **2**. A practice of merging code changes frequently and automatically
   testing them
6. **1**. Describing the desired state
7. **4**. Defining the exact steps to achieve a state
8. **3**. To ensure changes do not introduce errors or inconsistencies
9. **2**. They ensure the system reaches and maintains a desired state with
   less manual intervention
10. **4**. A system for managing changes to code and configurations with a
    history of changes
