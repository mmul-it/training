# Lab | Containers Environment Variables

In this lab you will:

1. Pull and run the `nginx` container image with the name `environment-var-test`
   passing the environment variable MESSAGE with the value of "Test content".
2. Log into the container and check that the content of the MESSAGE environment
   variable is what you set during the launch.
3. Exit the shell and enter again the shell, this time overriding the MESSAGE
   variable with a new value, let's say "Modified test content".
4. Exit again the shell and log once again without overriding the variable,
   checking the content of the variable.
5. Was the value changed? What does this mean?
6. Stop the `environment-var-test` container.

## Solution

1. Run the "nginx" container:

   ```console
   $ docker run --rm --detach \
       --env MESSAGE="Test content" \
       --name environment-var-test \
       nginx
   7c1f15079d3ca1e851af947d8cb673cfb80177421da21be3da3c35ab2c4609d6
   ```

2. Use a shell to log into the container and check the content of the variable:

   ```console
   $ docker exec --interactive --tty environment-var-test /bin/bash
   root@7c1f15079d3c:/# echo $MESSAGE
   Test content

   root@7c1f15079d3c:/# exit
   exit
   $
   ```

3. Use another shell, overriding the content of the variable:

   ```console
   $ docker exec --interactive --tty \
       --env MESSAGE="Modified test content" \
       environment-var-test /bin/bash
   root@d1a23db58736:/# echo $MESSAGE
   Modified test content

   root@7c1f15079d3c:/# exit
   exit
   $
   ```

4. Check another last time the status of the variable with no override:

   ```console
   $ docker exec --interactive --tty environment-var-test /bin/bash
   root@7c1f15079d3c:/# echo $MESSAGE
   Test content

   root@7c1f15079d3c:/# exit
   exit
   $
   ```

5. No, the value is still the original. This means that the override produced by
   the exec counts just from there on, it is not retroactive. Which means that
   the only way to reset the environment variable is to stop and start the
   container once again with a new `-e` or `--env` option specified.

6. Stop the `nginx` container:

   ```console
   $ docker stop environment-var-test
   environment-var-test
   ```
